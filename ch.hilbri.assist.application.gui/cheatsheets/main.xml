         This set of tasks provide guidance for the specifying a deployment problem in ASSIST.
<br/><br/>The <b>spatial allocation</b> describes the mapping of <b>software components</b> to <b>hardware resources</b>. Additional constraints may be defined based on the resource capacities or safety requirements, such as <b>dissimilarity</b> and <b>dislocality</b>. This allocation may not be schedulable.
