% The Package                      %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\chapter{Introduction}
This class provides a DLR layout scheme. It allows an easy change of the title page and of the page layout. In addition, it is possible to use the DLR corporate identity fonts with a suitable math font: \texttt{cmbright}.
\begin{equation}
E = m c^2
\label{eq:example}
\end{equation}

However, the package bases on the established KOMA-Skript and tries to keep as much features as possible of it "alive".

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\chapter{Usage}

\section{The \texttt{dlrtitle} Package}
This package renews \texttt{\textbackslash maketitle} command in order to change the appearance of the title page using the capabilities of TikZ. In addition, the command \texttt{\textbackslash reportno} is provided, which is similar to the \texttt{\textbackslash author} command.

The layout of the title page can be set up using the \texttt{\textbackslash settitle} command. It accepts key/value pairs. You can set the \texttt{type=plain} to chose a simple report layout. Setting \texttt{type=areas} creates a print category layout with the research areas' corporate design pictures. The research areas can be set with \texttt{area=aeronautics}, \texttt{area=space}, \texttt{area= transport}, \texttt{area=energy} and \texttt{area=custom}.
If \texttt{area=custom}, the user must supply the image \texttt{custom.*} in an accepted file format. An aspect ratio of 15/9 is advised, but not needed.
Acceptable formats are e.g. \texttt{custom.eps}, if you are using ps\LaTeX, or \texttt{custom.png} for pdf\LaTeX.

\section{The \texttt{dlrheaders} Package}
This package modifies the head and the foot line. Especial a DLR water mark and the report number is printed in the foot line. If the command \texttt{\textbackslash reportno} is not yet defined it is created. This package uses the capabilities of the \texttt{scrpage2} package.

\section{The \texttt{dlrelements} Package}
This package modifies the document fonts for titles and captions. It additionally changes the layout of tables and figures. Use \texttt{\textbackslash tablehead} to format table headings. See figure \ref{elements:figure} and table \ref{elements:table} for an example.

\begin{figure}[t]%
  \begin{subfigure}[b]{3cm}\centering
    \dlradler
    \caption{DLR adler}
    \label{elements:figure:adler1}
  \end{subfigure}
  \begin{subfigure}[b]{8cm}\centering
    \dlrlogo
    \caption{DLR logo}
    \label{elements:figure:logo1}
  \end{subfigure}
  \caption{Figure typeset with DLR elements}
  \label{elements:figure}
\end{figure}

\begin{table}\centering%
\begin{tabular}{lcr}
\dlrtablehead
 DLR   & layout & test   \\
 looks & nice,  & right? \\
 a     & second & row
\\\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Table typeset with DLR elements}
\label{elements:table}
\end{table}

The package provides the option \texttt{figures}, which takes the values \texttt{plain} or \texttt{dlr}. If \texttt{dlr} is set, the figure appear as seen in figure \ref{elements:figure}. Otherwise, the regular figure appearance is provided. The package options can be provided to the package directly or to the dlr document classes.


\section{The \texttt{dlrreprt} Class}
The packages above are combined within the \texttt{\textbackslash dlrreprt} class, which can be loaded with \texttt{\textbackslash documentclass\{dlrreprt\}} command instead of the \texttt{scrreprt} class. This will load the class with the default options.

The class is based on the \texttt{scrreprt} class. Options not recognised by the \texttt{dlrreprt} class are passed on to \texttt{scrreprt}.

\subsection{Option \texttt{frutiger}}
By default, the package also loads the DLR corporate identity fonts provided by the package \texttt{frutiger} with the \texttt{family} option. In order to provide a consistent layout with formulae, the package \texttt{cmbright} is loaded for math fonts. In oder to avoid changing default fonts, you can use \texttt{\textbackslash documentclass[frutiger=false]\{dlrreprt\}}.

\subsection{Option \texttt{title}}
By default, the package changes the appearance of the title page by renewing the command \texttt{\textbackslash maketitle}. Use \texttt{\textbackslash documentclass[title=false]\{dlrreprt\}}, if you wish to use the default title page.

\subsection{Option \texttt{page}}
By default, the package changes the page layout. This includes a header with the DLR logo, the publisher (usually the institute) and the current chapter. The footer is filled with either the document title or the report number and a page numbering, which also states the total count of pages in the body. If you wish to preserve the default page layout, use \texttt{\textbackslash documentclass[page=false]\{dlrreprt\}}.

\subsection{Option \texttt{elements}}
By default, the \texttt{dlrelements} package is loaded. You can prevent that by specifying \texttt{\textbackslash documentclass[elements=false]\{dlrreprt\}}.

\subsection{Command \texttt{\textbackslash reportno}}
The package provides a new command \texttt{\textbackslash reportno}, which similar to the \texttt{\textbackslash author} command in that it creates a variable for use in the title page. This command should be used to insert the internal report number of the document.

\clearpage
\section{The \texttt{dlrbook} Class}
The \texttt{\textbackslash dlrbook} class is similar to the \texttt{\textbackslash dlrreprt} class and accepts the same options. Instead of the \texttt{scrreprt} class is bases on the \texttt{scrbook} class. The main advantages of this \texttt{scrbook}  class is, that it is optimised for a two-sided book layout. In addition the commands \texttt{\textbackslash frontmatter}, \texttt{\textbackslash mainmatter}  and \texttt{\textbackslash backmatter} are provide to change among others the page numbering within the front matter etc. For further information it is referred to the documentation of KOMA-Script.

\subsection{Command \texttt{\textbackslash titlematter}}
In addition to the \texttt{\textbackslash frontmatter} command \texttt{\textbackslash titlematter} can be used to change the page numbering of the title page.

\section{The \texttt{dlrsecondpage} Package}
This package provides a second page containing an identification sheet for the document and a version history. The following commands can be used to fill out information in the identification sheet:
\begin{table}[bh]
        \centering
        \caption{Document identification provided by the \texttt{\textbackslash dlrsecondpage} package}
        \begin{tabular}{ll}
                \texttt{\textbackslash title}        & The document title \tabularnewline
                \texttt{\textbackslash subject}      & The general subject\tabularnewline
                \texttt{\textbackslash keywords}     & Some keywords\tabularnewline
                \texttt{\textbackslash restrictions} & Access restrictions\tabularnewline
                \texttt{\textbackslash author}       & The author\tabularnewline
                \texttt{\textbackslash telnumber}    & The author's internal telephone number\tabularnewline
                \texttt{\textbackslash faxnumber}    & The author's internal fax number\tabularnewline
                \texttt{\textbackslash email}        & The author's email\tabularnewline
                \texttt{\textbackslash savedby}      & The the last one to save the file\tabularnewline
                \texttt{\textbackslash coauthor}     & Contributors to the document\tabularnewline
                \texttt{\textbackslash approvedby}   & Who checked the document?\tabularnewline
                \texttt{\textbackslash releasedby}   & Who released the document to the access-granted group? \tabularnewline
        \end{tabular}
        \label{tab:DLRsecondpage}
\end{table}

The packages relies on the \texttt{listofversions} package for version handling. It additionally uses the \texttt{dlrinstitutes} package to retrieve information on the institute. It also uses the \texttt{username} package to set defaults for \texttt{\textbackslash savedby}. The second page can be generated using \texttt{\textbackslash secondpage}.
