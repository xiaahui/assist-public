\section{Introduction}
The user info package uses the Microsoft Active Directory (AD) to retrieve information on a specified username. (The username of the currently logged on user can be retrieved using the username package.) 

\section{Usage}
The package provides the command \textbackslash userinfo\{\textless username\textgreater\}\{\textless info type\textgreater\}. It retrieves the requested info type for the user username. Currently the following info types are supported:
\begin{description}
	\item[name]         The display name as retrieved by the flag -display and reordered
	\item[department]   The department name as of the flag -desc
	\item[email]        The email adress as of flag -email
	\item[telnumber]    The telefone number as of flag -tel
	\item[faxnumber]    The telefax number as of flag -fax
	\item[telextension] The extension number of the telefone
	\item[faxextension] The extension number of the telefax
	\item[dlrinstitute] The department abbreviation as of the flag -dept
	\item[dlrsite]      The site abbreviation as of the flag -dept
\end{description}
The latter two can also be used with the dlrinstitutes package.


\section{Usage}
The info from the AD is only loaded ones and cached in \texttt{*.adi} files. To recache the info, use the package option \texttt{recache}: \texttt{\textbackslash usepackage[recache]\{userinfo\}}.
