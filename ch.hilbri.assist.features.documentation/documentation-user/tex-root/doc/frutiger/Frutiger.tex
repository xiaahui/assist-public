\section{The Frutiger Fonts}
Frutiger is a sans-serif typeface which was created by the Swiss Adrian Frutiger. The available Frutiger fonts within this package are compiled in table \ref{tab:FrutigerFonts}.
\begin{table}[hb]

% Package Usage                    %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Package Usage}
The Frutiger package can be easily used within \LaTeX{}\footnote{Note: The fonts are display wrong in the dvi-file but right in the ps- and pdf-file.} and pdf-\LaTeX{} by using the \texttt{\textbackslash usepackage}-command. There are three possibilities to load the Frutiger package

\subsection{Changing \texttt{\textbackslash sffamily}}
In order to redefine \texttt{\textbackslash sffamily} load the Frutiger package without any options, i.\,e. by \texttt{\textbackslash usepackage\{frutiger\}}. The Frutiger font can now be easily activated using \texttt{\textbackslash sffamily}-command. Since this way of loading the Frutiger package effects every usage of \texttt{\textbackslash sffamily} a consistent layout is produced.


\subsection{Providing a \texttt{\textbackslash frutiger\{\}} Command}
In the case that Frutiger Fonts is to be only used in some few cases, the Frutiger package can be loaded by \texttt{\textbackslash usepackage[command]\{frutiger\}}. Herewith only a \texttt{\textbackslash frutiger\{\}} command is defined and no other changes are performed.

\subsection{Changing \texttt{\textbackslash familydefault}}
In order to redefine \texttt{\textbackslash familydefault} it is possible to load the Frutiger package with \texttt{\textbackslash usepackage[family]\{frutiger\}}. In that case, \texttt{\textbackslash sffamily} is redefined to Frutiger and \texttt{\textbackslash familydefault} is redefined to \texttt{\textbackslash sffamily}.

If you use the option \texttt{family} option, it is suggest to select a suitable non-serife math font, e.g. by \texttt{\textbackslash usepackage\{cmbright\}}. It is important that you load the \texttt{cmbright} package before the \texttt{frutiger} package.

\section{Package Installation}
The installation procedure for the Frutiger package on different operating systems is explained in the following.

%
% Windows           
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Windows: MiKTeX}
In order to correctly install the Frutiger package on a Windows system with MikTeX the following steps have to be performed. 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Copy the package to any desired path, e.\,g. to \texttt{D:\textbackslash My-LaTeX-Templates\textbackslash Frutiger\textbackslash}. It is important that you do not change the directory structure.
	\item Open the MikTeX Settings GUI and add the Frutiger package root path to the MikTeX root directory list. Click OK.
	\item Update the font map files:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Open a DOS console window.
			\item Run \texttt{initexmf -{}-edit-config-file updmap} to edit the font config file.
			\item Add the following lines:\\
						\texttt{Map frutiger-pdf.map} \\
						\texttt{Map frutiger-ps.map}
			\item Save and close the configuration file.
			\item Run \texttt{initexmf -{}-mkmaps} to rebuild the font map files.\footnote{On some systems \texttt{initexmf -{}-mkmaps} has to be executed after every restart of windows. In order to avoid this, you can add a suitable batch file to the Autostart folder in the Start Menu.} 
		\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
