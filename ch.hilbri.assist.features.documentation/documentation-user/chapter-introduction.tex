The ASSIST Toolsuite is for System Engineers and System Architects of safety-critical systems. 
It automates the construction of a mapping between equipment interfaces and the pins of an RDC while respecting safety and reliability requirements.

The ASSIST Toolsuite aims to automate this challenging, error prone and complex task. 
It requires the user to specify:

\begin{itemize}
\item the resource requirements of the equipment interfaces,
\item the features and capabilities of the RDCs and
\item safety and reliability requirements
\end{itemize}

in a textual domain specific language.

This specification of a mapping problem is automatically transfered into Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP). 
Solutions for this CSP represent correct deployments. 
They are automatically generated with the constraint solver \emph{Choco3}. 
Solutions can also be evaluated and optimized based on pre-defined or customizable metrics.
