\label{cha:example-input}

In Listing~\ref{lst:example-input} an example specification is described. 
This example illustrates the specifications that are possible with the current version of ASSIST.
Comments are used to further document the intended specification. 
Single-line comments are prefixed with \verb|//|.
Multi-line comments have to be placed between \verb|/*| and \verb|*/|.
The entire specification language is white space tolerant, so that additional white spaces can be added between keywords without violating its syntax.
