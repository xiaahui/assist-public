 * A value iterator can be iterated in 2 ways: bottom-up (from lower bound to upper bound) <br/>
 * and top-down (from upper bound to lower bound).<br/>
 * To iterate in bottom-up way, first call bottomUpInit(), then hasNext() and next().<br/>
 * To iterate in bottom-up way, first call topDownInit(), then hasPrevious() and previous().<br/>
 * <br/>
 * Once a way is selected, using the wrong methods can lead to unexpected behaviour.
